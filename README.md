![](https://www.deepchecks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/post-what-is-llm-as-judge.jpg)

In today's competitive business landscape, leveraging technology to enhance sales strategies is more critical than ever. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing sales call transcripts, offering insights that can refine sales motions and improve overall performance. However, biases inherent in LLMs can significantly impact the accuracy and consistency of these analyses.

This post explores how LLM biases affect sales motion analysis, delving into the technical challenges and providing practical examples. We'll discuss why LLMs may produce inconsistent results when interpreting sales motions and offer strategies to mitigate these biases, maximizing the potential of AI in sales analytics.

## Understanding Sales Motion and Sales Process

Before diving into the technical intricacies, it's essential to distinguish between two foundational concepts:

- **Sales Motion**: The overarching strategy or methodology a company employs to sell its products or services. It defines the approach to customer engagement, reflecting the company's philosophy and value proposition.

- **Sales Process**: The specific, repeatable steps taken during the sales cycle, such as prospecting, qualifying leads, presenting solutions, handling objections, and closing deals.

While the sales process outlines *what* actions are taken, the sales motion explains *how* and *why* those actions are executed in a particular way. Different companies tailor their sales motions to align with their products, target markets, and business objectives, leading to a diversity that requires nuanced understanding.

## How LLMs Analyze Sales Calls

LLMs are advanced AI models trained on vast datasets to understand and generate human-like text. In sales analytics, LLMs are used to:

- **Transcribe Calls**: Convert audio recordings into text for analysis.
- **Extract Insights**: Identify key themes, customer objections, and sentiments.
- **Classify Sales Motions**: Determine the sales strategies used during the interactions.

For example, an LLM might analyze a transcript and conclude that a sales representative is employing a consultative selling approach based on the dialogue's content and structure.

---

## The Challenge: LLMs and Subjectivity

### **Subjectivity and Context Dependence**

LLMs, despite their sophistication, face challenges when interpreting subjective and context-dependent concepts like "good" sales practices. This difficulty arises from:

- **Cultural and Individual Variations**: What constitutes an effective sales motion can vary widely across different industries, cultures, and individual customer preferences.

- **Contextual Nuance**: The same sales technique might be appropriate in one context but ineffective or even detrimental in another.

### **Technical Limitations**

LLMs generate responses based on patterns in their training data. They may lack:

- **Deep Contextual Understanding**: While LLMs can process context within the text, they may not fully grasp situational nuances that influence sales interactions.

- **Consistency in Interpretation**: Variations in wording or phrasing can lead to different interpretations, especially when prompts are ambiguous.

---

## An Experiment in Sales Motion Analysis

To illustrate these challenges, consider an experiment where an LLM analyzes the same sales call transcript multiple times to identify the sales motion used.

### **The Sales Call Transcript**

A conversation between a sales representative and a prospective client discussing a SaaS solution to enhance productivity. The dialogue includes elements like:

- Identifying customer challenges.
- Presenting tailored solutions.
- Addressing concerns about integration and support.
- Proposing next steps with a personalized demo.

### **The LLM's Task**

The model is prompted with:

```plaintext
What is the `sales motion`?
```

### **Variable Outputs**

Despite using the same transcript, the LLM provides different answers across multiple runs:

1. **Solution Selling**
2. **Consultative Selling**
3. **Problem-Agitate-Solve (PAS)**
4. **Addressing Customer Challenges Proactively**
5. **Showcase Benefits and Build Trust**

---

## Analyzing the Variability

### **Reasons for Inconsistent Outputs**

1. **Randomness in Generation**

   - **Temperature Settings**: LLMs use a parameter called *temperature* to control randomness. A higher temperature results in more varied outputs, while a lower temperature makes the model more deterministic.
   - **Impact**: If the temperature isn't fixed, the model may produce different responses even with the same input.

2. **Ambiguity in Prompts**

   - **Open-Ended Questions**: The prompt "What is the `sales motion`?" is broad, allowing the model to interpret it in various ways.
   - **Impact**: Without specific guidance, the LLM may focus on different aspects of the conversation each time.

3. **Biases in Training Data**

   - **Overrepresentation**: The model might favor certain sales methodologies prevalent in its training data.
   - **Underrepresentation**: Less common sales motions may not be adequately recognized.

### **Technical Explanation**

LLMs generate text by predicting the next word in a sequence based on learned probabilities. Without constraints, minor differences in initial conditions can lead to divergent paths due to the vast possibility space in language generation.

---

## Impact of LLM Biases

### **Business Implications**

- **Misclassification of Sales Strategies**: Inaccurate identification of sales motions can lead to ineffective training and strategy development.
- **Inconsistent Performance Metrics**: Variability in analysis affects the reliability of performance evaluations and KPIs.
- **Decision-Making Risks**: Relying on biased outputs may result in misguided business decisions.

### **Examples**

- A sales manager might implement unnecessary training programs if the LLM incorrectly suggests that sales reps are not using the prescribed sales motion.
- Inconsistent analyses could lead to confusion among sales teams about which strategies are most effective.

## Mitigating LLM Biases

To enhance the reliability of LLM analyses, consider the following strategies:

### **1. Fine-Tuning the Model**

**Action**: Train the LLM on domain-specific data, including company-specific sales interactions and terminology.

**Benefit**: The model becomes more attuned to the nuances of your sales motions and less influenced by general biases.

**Example**: By incorporating transcripts of successful sales calls that exemplify your company's sales motion, the LLM learns to recognize and classify similar patterns accurately.

### **2. Providing Clear and Specific Prompts**

**Action**: Use detailed instructions to guide the LLM's focus.

**Improved Prompt**:

```plaintext
Based on the transcript, identify the sales motion used. Choose from the following options:

- Solution Selling
- Consultative Selling
- Transactional Selling
- SPIN Selling

Please provide your answer in one of the above terms.
```

**Benefit**: Reduces ambiguity and limits the model's response scope, leading to more consistent outputs.

### **3. Adjusting Model Parameters**

**Action**: Set the temperature parameter to zero for deterministic outputs.

**Benefit**: Eliminates randomness, ensuring the same input yields the same output every time.

**Technical Note**: In models like GPT, `temperature=0` makes the model choose the highest probability token at each step.

### **4. Implementing a Human-in-the-Loop**

**Action**: Combine AI analysis with human expertise for validation.

**Benefit**: Human reviewers can catch and correct misclassifications, enhancing overall accuracy.

**Example**: Sales managers review the LLM's output to confirm the identified sales motion aligns with the company's strategies.

### **5. Updating the Model Regularly**

**Action**: Continuously retrain the model with new data to reflect changes in sales strategies and market dynamics.

**Benefit**: Keeps the model's understanding current, reducing the risk of outdated biases.

---

## Demonstrating the Solution

By applying the strategies above, let's revisit the experiment with improved parameters.

### **Updated Prompt and Parameters**

- **Prompt**:

  ```plaintext
  Based on the transcript, identify the sales motion used, choosing from: Solution Selling, Consultative Selling, Transactional Selling, or SPIN Selling.
  ```

- **Temperature**: Set to 0 for deterministic output.

### **Expected Consistent Output**

The LLM now consistently identifies the sales motion as:

```plaintext
Consultative Selling
```

### **Analysis**

- **Alignment with Content**: The sales representative engages in understanding the client's challenges and offers tailored solutions, characteristic of consultative selling.
- **Reduced Variability**: By constraining the response options and eliminating randomness, the LLM provides consistent and accurate analyses.

## Defining the `sample_function`

```python
def sample_function(question="", max_word=5):
    sample_call = """
    **Call Transcript**
    ...
    **End of Call**
    ======================
    """
    response = ollama.chat(model='llama3.2:3b', messages=[
        {
            'role': 'system',
            'content': f'You are a helpful AI assistant who analyzes call transcripts. [important! response must always be max {max_word} words]'
        },
        {
            'role': 'user',
            'content': f'[call]\n{sample_call}\n[/call]\n\n\n{question} [important! max {max_word} words]',
        },
    ])
    print(response['message']['content'])
    ai_msg = response['message']['content']
    return ai_msg
```

### Breakdown

- **Function Purpose**: Analyzes a sales call transcript using an LLM to answer a specific question.
- **Parameters**:
  - `question`: The question to ask the LLM.
  - `max_word`: The maximum number of words allowed in the LLM's response.

### Steps Inside the Function

1. **Defining the Transcript**: A multi-line string `sample_call` contains the transcript of a sales call between Jane Doe (sales rep) and John Smith (prospective client).

2. **Preparing the LLM Request**:
   - The `ollama.chat()` function is called with the following parameters:
     - `model`: Specifies the LLM model to use (`'llama3.2:3b'`).
     - `messages`: A list of messages simulating a conversation with the LLM.
       - **System Message**: Sets the context, instructing the LLM to act as a helpful AI assistant analyzing call transcripts. It emphasizes that the response must be within the `max_word` limit.
       - **User Message**: Contains the call transcript and the question to be answered, again emphasizing the word limit.

3. **Processing the Response**:
   - Prints the LLM's response to the console.
   - Extracts the response content and returns it.

## Running the Function in Parallel with `run_function_in_parallel`

```python
def run_function_in_parallel(func: Callable, N: int, question: str, max_word: int) -> Dict[int, Any]:
    # Initialize Ray if it hasn't been initialized yet
    if not ray.is_initialized():
        ray.init(ignore_reinit_error=True)

    # Define a remote version of the input function
    @ray.remote
    def remote_func():
        return func(question, max_word)

    # Launch N parallel tasks
    futures = [remote_func.remote() for _ in range(N)]

    # Wait for all tasks to complete and gather results
    results = ray.get(futures)

    # Create a dictionary mapping run indices to results
    result_dict = {i: result for i, result in enumerate(results)}

    return result_dict
```

### Breakdown

- **Function Purpose**: Executes a given function `N` times in parallel using Ray and collects the results.
- **Parameters**:
  - `func`: The function to execute (in this case, `sample_function`).
  - `N`: The number of times to run the function in parallel.
  - `question`: The question to pass to the function.
  - `max_word`: The maximum word limit for the LLM's response.

### Steps Inside the Function

1. **Initializing Ray**: Checks if Ray is initialized; if not, initializes it with `ray.init()`.

2. **Defining the Remote Function**:
   - Uses the `@ray.remote` decorator to define `remote_func()`, which calls `func(question, max_word)`.

3. **Launching Parallel Tasks**:
   - Creates a list of futures by calling `remote_func.remote()` `N` times.
   - Each call to `remote_func.remote()` schedules the function for execution in parallel.

4. **Collecting Results**:
   - Uses `ray.get(futures)` to retrieve the results once all tasks are complete.
   - Maps each result to its run index in a dictionary.

5. **Returning Results**: Provides a dictionary where keys are run indices, and values are the corresponding results.

---

## Main Execution Block

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Number of parallel runs
    N = 5

    # Run the function in parallel
    results = run_function_in_parallel(sample_function, N, question="What is the `sales motion`?", max_word=5)

    # Print the results
    for run_id, result in results.items():
        print(f"Run {run_id}: Result = {result}")
    # Shutdown Ray (optional)
    ray.shutdown()
```

### Steps

1. **Setting the Number of Runs**: `N = 5` specifies that the function will run five times in parallel.

2. **Running the Analysis**:
   - Calls `run_function_in_parallel()` with the `sample_function`, passing the question and word limit.

3. **Displaying the Results**:
   - Iterates over the results dictionary and prints each run's output.

4. **Shutting Down Ray**: Calls `ray.shutdown()` to clean up resources.

## Observing the Outputs

### Sample Outputs

```
# TEST 1
Run 0: Result = Solution sales with demos.
Run 1: Result = SaaS platform as solution seller.
Run 2: Result = Problem-Agitate-Solve (PAS) sales motion.
Run 3: Result = Addressing challenges, showcasing benefits.
Run 4: Result = Solution showcase and demo.
```

### Analysis

- **Variability**: Each run produces a different result, even though the input transcript and question are the same.
- **Inconsistency**: The LLM identifies different sales motions or provides varied descriptions.

---

## Understanding the Variability

### Why Do the Outputs Vary?

1. **Randomness in LLMs**:
   - LLMs often include a degree of randomness (controlled by parameters like temperature) to generate diverse and creative responses.
   - Even with the same input, the model may produce different outputs due to this randomness.

2. **Ambiguity in the Question**:
   - The question "What is the `sales motion`?" is open-ended.
   - Without specific guidance, the LLM may interpret the question differently each time.

3. **Biases in Training Data**:
   - The LLM's training data may influence it to favor certain sales methodologies.
   - Lack of exposure to specific sales motions can lead to inconsistent identification.

### Impact of Variability

- **Unreliable Analysis**: Inconsistent outputs make it challenging to rely on the LLM for accurate sales motion analysis.
- **Decision-Making Challenges**: Businesses may struggle to make informed decisions based on inconsistent insights.
